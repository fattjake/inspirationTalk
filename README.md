#### Jacob Gundersen (*Podcaster, iOS 5-8 by Tutorials, iOS Games by Tutorials*)

###### Session: Opportunity
###### Track: Inspiration
###### Location: Metropolitan Center
###### Description:
Opportunities to do interesting projects come from so many different sources. Some times we don't recognize them when they're offered to us, for a variety of reasons. When you learn to reach for opportunities, you'll do more interesting projects, work with people you admire, and experience personal growth that can surprise you.  This talk is a chance to consider doing things that stretch in ways that make you a better programmer and professional.
